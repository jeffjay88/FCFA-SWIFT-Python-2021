# FCFA-SWIFT Python training 2021

Hi!

You're looking at the repository for the 7th to 12th June 2021 FCFA
African-SWIFT Python training course.

The repository contains all the Jupyter notebooks which make up the course
training material (including example answers to the exercises)

## Course overview

The course time-table is below (note: all times are in local-time in
Ghana, so UTC+0)

The course is taught over a number of sessions, with each session introducing a new set of topics. Each session has an associated Jupyter notebook (see below) which contains background information introducing you to the topic and a set of exercises for you to work through.

- Monday:
  
  - numpy and matplotlib (using CSV, ASCII and XLXS files): [numpy_matplotlib.ipynb](notebooks/numpy_matplotlib.ipynb)

- Tuesday:
  
  - numpy, matplotlib & cartopy: [numpy_matplotlib_cartopy.ipynb](notebooks/numpy_matplotlib_cartopy.ipynb)
  
  - pandas: [pandas.ipynb](notebooks/pandas.ipynb)

- Wednesday:
  
  - pandas (with seaborn): [pandas_seaborn_.ipynb](notebooks/pandas_seaborn_.ipynb)
  
  - xarray (subsetting data): [xarray_part1.ipynb](notebooks/xarray_part1.ipynb)

- Thursday:
  
  - xarray (grouping data): [xarray_part2.ipynb](notebooks/xarray_part2.ipynb)
  
  - xarray + cartopy: [xarray_cartopy.ipynb](notebooks/xarray_cartopy.ipynb)

- Friday:
  
  - xarray + metpy: [xarray_metpy.ipynb](notebooks/xarray_metpy.ipynb)
  
  - xarray + cartopy: [xarray_xclim.ipynb](notebooks/xarray_xclim.ipynb)

All notebooks are stored in [notebooks/](notebooks/). There are also a set of sample answers for each exercise in [notebooks__sample_answers/](notebooks__sample_answers/) - but wait to look at this until after you've completed the course :)

## Getting started

**TODO**: add instructions on how to download/clone this repository and
how to get the datasets we will be working with

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/leifdenby/FCFA-SWIFT-Python-2021/HEAD)

If you are having difficulty getting set up on your own computer you may
click the "launch on binder"-link above. **Note**: when you run the
exercises on binder what you write will not be saved locally and so you
will loose your work if you close the browser.
